# NoamCam
A project using popular modules such as CV, WXPython, and more.

The main purpose of the project is a system in which an individual/company/group of people can monitor multiple places at once, a lot like the popular systems you would see in Movies and TV Shows, and it is used in real life as well.

Some more features of the project includes: Face detecting (turning it on and off), Secure log in (Using a username and password), sounding an alert when a face was detected (when Face detection feature is active on it) or manually, recording the live feeds, zooming on a cetain live feed and more.
